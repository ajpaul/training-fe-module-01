# Backbase Training Exercise

## Portal Frontend - Module 1

### Exercise 2

_note: This exercise is 3 of 7 in a series of exercises that follow on from each other and should not be used independently_
_note: All exercises use the [standard portal set-up for backbase trainings](https://my.backbase.com/resources/how-to-guides/getting-your-first-launchpad-based-portal-set-up/)_

#### Description

In this exercise, you will create the basic layout and functionality for your todo widget using Launchpad UI Components.

#### Steps

 - There is a text input and a submit button. The submit button should be disabled, unless there is some text in the input field
 - When you press the submit button, whatever is in the text input is added in the todos list
 - Each todo can be marked as done/not done by clicking a checkbox in front of it. The whole row gets a class **bt-todo-done** (no styling)
 - Each todo should have a button to be able to remove it
 - No storing required
 - No need to check for duplicate tasks
 - Try to use as many Launchpad UI components as possible (refer to the documentation in your local styleguide, or [here](http://launchpad.backbase.com:8080/bundles/launchpad-bundles/modules/ui/scripts/components/))
