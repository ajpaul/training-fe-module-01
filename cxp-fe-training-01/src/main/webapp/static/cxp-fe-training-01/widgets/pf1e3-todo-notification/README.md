#### Description

To enhance your widget

#### Steps

 - Based on your preference, your widget should have a maximum number of not done todos. User shouldn't be able to add more, until he marks one as done
 - Make your Todo widget responsive. When less than 400px, the checkboxes should not appear, and the toggling of done/not done should happen by clicking the whole row
 - Create a notification widget. When you add a todo, this notification widget should display for 5 seconds: **"Todo added, total todos <amount of todos>"**
