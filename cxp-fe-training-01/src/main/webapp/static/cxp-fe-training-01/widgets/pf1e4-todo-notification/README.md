_note: This exercise is 5 of 5 in a series of exercises that follow on from each other and should not be used independently_
_note: All exercises use the [standard portal set-up for backbase trainings](https://my.backbase.com/resources/how-to-guides/getting-your-first-launchpad-based-portal-set-up/)_

#### Description

In this exercise, you will style your widget using Twitter Bootstrap's CSS toolkit.

#### Steps

 - Using Twitter Bootstrap, make your "Delete Todo" button red, and with a trash bin as icon
 - Make your delete buttons black, by changing the variable in the default theme
 - The todos that are done, should have a ~~strike-through~~. Todo items that are not done should be bold
 - Create a global behavior, using only CSS. When hovering over an element, a button inside it appears. Use this behavior for your "delete todo" buttons
