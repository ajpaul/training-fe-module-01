#### Description

To style your widget

#### Steps

 - Using Twitter Bootstrap, make your "Delete Todo" button red, and with a trash bin as icon
 - Make your delete buttons black, by changing the variable in the default theme
 - The todos that are done, should have a ~~strike-through~~. Todo items that are not done should be bold
 - Create a global behavior, using only CSS. When hovering over an element, a button inside it appears. Use this behavior for your "delete todo" buttons
